        "You are to build a class called dice_game and save this in a python script called a1.py.  You will submit a1.py below.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Below describes a game that you will model using the class dice_game.\n",
        "\n",
        "## The Business Problem:\n",
        "\n",
        "The newly constructed Encore Casino in Boston Harbor is evaluating the creation of a new table game involving the rolling of a dice.  The Casino has hired your analytics firm to better understand the risk of the proposed idea.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Their proposal:\n",
        "\n",
        "The roll of a 6-sided dice occurs a minimum of two times, but per the rules of the game, could require an additional 3rd roll.\n",
        "\n",
        "A dice is defined as an entity that when rolled, it will return a single value between 1 and 6 often referred to as the face value.\n",
        "\n",
        "The face values of 1,2,3,4,5,6 are all equally likely.\n",
        "\n",
        "The casino has found that the typical user joins a table with 10 credits, and are planning on charging a single credit for a play of the game.  That is, prior to a the start of a game, the player has 1 credit deducted from their wallet.\n",
        "\n",
        "Only one player can be at the table at a time.\n",
        "\n",
        "## The Rules:\n",
        "\n",
        "Before a game takes place, the player must hand over 1 credit to the casino.\n",
        "\n",
        "A game is initiated by rolling a dice, two separate times, and recording the Grand Total for the game, which is the sum of the first and second rolls.\n",
        "\n",
        "If the Grand Total after two rolls of the dice is less than or equal to 9, the dice must be rolled one more time, with the face value recorded and added to the Grand Total.\n",
        "\n",
        "If the Grand Total after two rolls of the dice is greater than 10, no more rolls of the dice will take place.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the event that the Grand Total is equal to 10, a 3rd roll should conditionally take place and simulate a user's decision. This roll will occur based on decision of a random process. That is, approximately 70% of the time, a third roll should take place and add the face value of the roll to the Grand Total. If the process determines that a roll should not take place (approximately 30% of the time), the Grand Total is taken from the previous two rolls of the dice.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Once the game has concluded, the proposed payout structure is as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "- A Grand Total of 11 or less results in a loss for the user. That is, no payout.\n",
        "- A Grand Total of 12 pays out 1 credit\n",
        "- A Grand Total of 13, 14, or 15 pays out 2 credits\n",
        "- A Grand Total of 16 or 17 results in a loss for the user. That is, no payout.\n",
        "- A Grand Total of 18 pays out 5 credits\n",
        "\n",
        "### The player must leave the table under one of two conditions:\n",
        "\n",
        "- They run out of credits\n",
        "- They have played the game 25 times.\n",
        "Your Challenge:\n",
        "\n",
        "Create a class called dice_game and save your work in a python script (not a notebook or a notebook renamed to .py) called a1.py.\n",
        "\n",
        "Your dice_game class will allow the Casino to study and simulate the outcomes based on their proposal.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Your class should have the following instance attributes:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **wallet** which is a list of integers. Each entry in wallet should itemizes the player's final credits after attempting to sit at the table. A value of 0 in the list represents the player ran out of money, otherwise, the total credits remaining after 25 rounds of the game. By default, this list is empty.\n",
        "2. **games_played** which is a list of integers. Each entry should itemize how many plays of the game occurred for a player sitting down at the table. The maximum value for any entry in the list must be 25. By default, this list is empty.\n",
        "3. **players** which is an integer. By default, this value should be 50 and internally represents the number of players the casino believes will play in a given day.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Your class should have the following methods:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **simulate** which will simulate a session at the table for a number of players. The number of players is defined by players attribute described above.\n",
        "2. **avg_rounds** which will return an integer indicating the average rounds at the table for all players simulated via simulate\n",
        "3. **profit** which will return an integer indicating the net number of credits the Casino can expect to make or lose across the simulation of the game for all players\n",
        "\n",
        "The methods avg_rounds and profit should print a message \"No simulated data\" in the event that the method simulate has not been run.  \n",
        "\n",
        "## A few notes:\n",
        "\n",
        "I do give partial credit for my checks against your work\n",
        "I should be able to import a1.py into my session without error and instantiate an object of the class dice_game without error.\n",
        "The essence of the challenge is to replicate a player sitting at the table playing the game for a number of players that can be configured within the object.  You will log the details for each player and game for review by the casino for inspection.\n",
        "\n",
        "### TIP:  Do not try to write all of the code at once from top to bottom.  Start by defining your class first, and try to break the challenge down into smaller parts as you go, which will help partial credit!\n",
        "\n",
        "### NOTE:  Each test against an attribute or method is worth the same amount of points, so prioritize your time accordingly.\n",
        "\n",
        "Submit a1.py below.  Please note that your submission must be included via QTools and submissions via email will not be accepted."
